<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Laura. I am an engineering study with an interest in developing my own projects. For this, I decided to
  take on web development. This allows me to realise the ideas that I have in my head. The course that I am taking requires
  multiple projects to be made. This website shows you the projects I have learned in the past.
